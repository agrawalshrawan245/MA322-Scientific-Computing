Fifth semester course at IITG

NOTE:
If there are any mistakes in the code in the folders of the corresponding labs then check the relevant portion in Endsem Practice.
I discovered that there were some mistakes in the codes that I submitted during the semester while preparing for the Endsem exam. 
So there is a chance that the correct snippet of code is in one of the files in the Endsem Practice folder.
